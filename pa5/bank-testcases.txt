You make accounts, you try to break it. You add and subtract numbers. "Just see what happens" 


Basically, everything you're supposed to do, you do it. If something unexpected happened, it's broken. 

I will say the implementation used doesn't let the balence go below zero, even though this would happen in a real bank. 
Changing this would be relatively simple thing to do, it would just add a couple more errors to check for is all.
